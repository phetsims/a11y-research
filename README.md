# a11y-research
A repository to track PhETs research into accessibility, or "a11y" for short.  This repository
tracks and organizes general accessibility questions and issues.  Code in this repository
is mostly raw HTML, which will either be used to think through accessibility design questions or
to test ARIA behavior and support for various screen reader and browser combinations.

Issues in this repository also track bug reports related to accessibility or ARIA support that are sent to various browsers and user agents.
