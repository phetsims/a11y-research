# General Design Considerations

Starting this document to track design considerations that we may need to keep in mind as we learn more about the accessibility design features being created for simulations.

## Design Considerations
In your consideratons, please indicate:
- an example
- that it is simulation specific
- that is very general, and/or
- if the design consideration is sim-specific, and could have general implications.

### Examples
- **Genereal design consideration** might be related to the common parts of a simulation, like the naming of common regions (Scene, Summary, Play Area, Control Panel, etc.), how we design the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog, or how we use interaction hints to scaffold users, etc.

- **Simulation specific considerations** are specific to a simulation and may or may not have general implications. For example, in _Balloons and Static Electricity_, the custom interaction of moving the balloon could warrant a stronger emphasis on checking out the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog. Where and how to cue the importance of a design feature or resource is specific to BASE in this case, but may influence how we cue custom interactions in general.

## Custom Interactions
- **Sim:** Balloons and Static Electricity
- **Sim Consideration:** Considering how beneficial the custom keyboard shortcuts, specifically the Jump Keys (JW, JS, JN, JC) are for this simualtion for non-visual users, should teh cue in the Scene Summary be stronger?
- **General Consideration:**
- **Interview Data:** 
  - At least one user who had explored both BASE and another sim indicated that the information in the Keybaord Shortcuts dialog was more critical in BASE than in teh other sim (was Ohm's Law or Resistance in a Wire).
  - Most users who read about the shortcuts used them. Of this who used them, liked them, and some commented that they made the interactions faster.

### Suggestions
> If needed, checkout the Keyboard Shortcuts for this sim under Sim Resources.

- If needed, checkout the Keyboard Shortcuts under Sim Resources. This sim has custom shortcuts.
- If needed, checkout the Keyboard Shortcuts under Sim Resources. This sim has a custom interaction.
