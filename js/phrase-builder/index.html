  <h3>Dynamic Phrase Manipulator</h3>
  <p>
    This phrase creator is designed to support prototyping dynamic descriptions. To use, first input description
    content in the first text area. Within that area, factor out sections that may have dynamic content (multiple
    options) into variables annotated like "{{templateVariable}}". Each of these (note two curly braces on each side and
    no spaces) will be automatically detected, and a ui created for them to input each possible dynamic option for that
    variable. An example sentence may look like "I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and {{otherFruit}}." In this case, a
    single variable text box will be added, and each option for "otherFruit" can be added on a new line there.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the input sentence and variable options are populated, the output will display the original sentence, but with
    each variable filled in with a select box filled with all the dynamic options filled in for that variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Refreshing the page will automatically load the most recently autosaved descriptions.
